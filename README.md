# Play Responsive IlluminesceSense

## Overview

Our product offers a much needed unique experience to stage lighting and entertainment venues. Customers of our products face varying revenues based on event popularity and overall attendance. Responding to this, our interactive lighting displays provide an added experience to patrons of the locale. This technology enables users to create lighting patterns throughout the space by simple input interactions. By supplying these interactive art forms to a social hotspot, the customerâ€™s venue will be of superior value to the patron.

## Approach

The Infinity Display is a combination of an infinity mirror and a LED matrix. An infinity mirror is an illusion created as a result of two parallel mirrors reflecting light back and forth. The image produced to a viewer is a tunnel. An LED matrix is a common product that works just like a TV, but much brighter and at a very low pixel density.  Combining these two creates a unique visual experience. For this project, I will enhance the functionality of this display by creating an easy to use UI to drive the LEDs. This web app will be accessible to users of the venue and based on their inputs, create unique lighting patterns.

## Deliverable 1

Creation of the display has already been accomplished with a rudimentary GUI to manipulate different animations, music reactivity, and filtering. The system runs on the Processing IDE and is easily accessible as long as the users can specify the correct COM channel. External user development is doable, under the assumption of their understanding of the Processing language. The largest restriction to third party users would be access to the actual hardware. However, the GUI renders a digital image of the display that can be used as a visual aid. Users with access to a LED matrix only need to specify display dimensions for the code to run.

## Deliverable 2

The next iteration of this project would be to connect the device running the LEDs to a web application. The same GUI items used right now can be copied over to a play responsive website. The inputs from a single user will render an animation to the page, then map it to the LED display. The largest hurdle will be the communication between the server and the device running the LEDs.

## Deliverable 3

After a single user input is implemented, the scope of the project can then focus on multi user inputs. Possibly in junction with a default animation, users will be assigned a single or small group of LEDs and control the movement with their mouse or touchpad. The presets of the pixel will be set by the user. Because the display has 576 LEDs, the system could handle hundreds of users.
